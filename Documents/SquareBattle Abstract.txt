SquareBattle is a platform for pre-written code modules, or "Squares", to compete in an arena, trying to eliminate other Squares through efficiency and strategy.  

Squares are written as children of a parent LabVIEW Class, demonstrating and teaching concepts of object oriented programming, inheritance and dynamic dispatch.

A SquareBattle demo will be on display in the LabVIEW Zone of the expo floor.  Participants can enter their code submissions to show up in the demo and compete for prizes.

SquareBattle has been used in LabVIEW User Group meetings, certification summits, and training classes for introducing LabVIEW Class programming concepts, education and fun.
